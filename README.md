## üìö Summary

> OpenMEV is a (permission-based) RPC network layer connected to MEV-enabled block producer pools. By having a private connection we can enable protocols and dapps a consistent protection against MEV (maximal extracted value). MEV is a category of transactions that include 'sandwich trades, front running, back running, arbitrage, etc'. Additional services can be built and offered, such as 'Pay for Order Flow', 'Account Abstraction (Buterin, EIP 4337), Carrier Transactions, etc. By privatizing user transaction flow we can enable the recapture of arbitrage/slippage back to the originating user trade.

eth_mining 
eth_hashrate 
eth_accounts 
eth_syncing 
eth_coinbase 
net_listening 
net_peerCount 
net_version 
web3_clientVersion 
 ```
 
## Supported RPC

These are all methods we expose and proxy  to our internal eth clients 
 ```
eth_blockNumber 
eth_call 
eth_estimateGas 
eth_gasPrice 
eth_getBalance 
eth_getBlockByHash 
eth_getBlockByNumber

### OpenMEV

To send a transaction that you would want a rebate on, you use this custom rpc methods: 

```
manifold_sendTransaction   
```

#### RPC Endpoints

##### HTTPS

https://api.sushirelay.com/v1

### WebSocket

#### Staging
```
wss://api-stag.sushirelay.com/v1
```
#### Production

```
wss://api.sushirelay.com/v1
```

#### Example: Websocket usage

```sh
$ wscat -c wss://api.sushirelay.com/v1
```
```sh
< {"method":"manifold_motd","jsonrpc":"2.0","params":{"result":{"notice":"THIS IS A NOTICE OF MONITORING OF MANIFOLD FINANCE, INC NETWORK INFORMATION SYSTEMS  By logging into Manifold Finance, Inc computer systems, you acknowledge and consent to monitoring of this system.  Network Policy <https://docs.manifoldfinance.com/network/policy>  By using this network, you certify that you have read, understand, and agree to abide by the Rules of Behavior for Manifold Finance Network Platform."}}}

## üß∞ Specification

> Engineering Goals and Specification

OpenMEV is built ontop of our 'backbone platform'. Backbone is built on baremetal instances, with OVH, equinix bare metal, and hetzner as the main providers. Nix/Kotlin/Kubernetes/kdb+/redpanda are the primary tech stack components.

### Dashboard

A Grafana dashboard utilizing OAuth2 via GitHub is available for partners and integration users.

Example screenshots with information redacted are provided below

### Design goals

- **Pre-trade privacy**
Pre-trade privacy implies transactions only become publicly known after they have been included in a block. Note, this type of privacy does not exclude privileged actors such as transaction aggregators / gateways / miners.
- **Failed trade privacy**
Failed trade privacy implies loosing bids are never included in a block, thus never exposed to the public. Failed trade privacy is tightly coupled to extraction efficiency.
- **Complete privacy**
Complete privacy implies there are no privileged actors such as transaction aggregators / gateways / miners who can observe incoming transactions.
- **Finality**
Finality implies it is infeasible for MEV extraction to be reversed once included in a block. This would protect against time-bandit chain re-org attacks.

### Architecture Goals

#### Redundant resources (trade cost)
Having redundant resources to avoid single points of failure.
 Every component can fail, but the system is robust enough that an individual outage can be tolerated.

#### Degraded results (trade quality)
For some services, it might be acceptable to trade quality for reliability. 
Instead of expecting every transaction to succeed, it can be tolerable for a business to see some requests fail.

#### Retry transient failures (trade latency)
If a response isn't returned in the expected time, the system sends the same request again.


## üìê Technical Integration / SDK

1. [OpenMEV Ethersjs Provider](https://github.com/manifoldfinance/openmev-provider)

Expanding Integration to have a unstyled widget component and react hook. 

### New Features for SDK

- Populates back to user errors from all rpc endpoints
- Populates back to user an exception if rejected for malformed/defects
- Users can query the state of their transactions
- Users can query their 'status': pending rebates, total rebates, 

- Path Optimization 
- Aggreation layer optional
